    "This notebook runs the scraper for our baseline sample. This consists of IDs that we have collected from different sources. Below, we describe the sample we used to begin with. This gave us a first body of IDs. The next phase is randomization (below) which simply tries to guess and record IDs. \n",

    "    Due to the possibility of nonstandard ID tags, one maker recalls the suspicious ID tags distributed in FY2020. The company announced the ID numbers subject to the recall on its website. Satoshi is confused! Especially for smaller ID numbers on the list, Satoshi found the IDs are already registered in the database. If the IDs are newly issued in 2020, why are they already on the database? One possibility is the tags accidentally came off and the farmers needed to get new tags with the same IDs. Another possibility is that the gov reuses the same IDs several years after death, or slaughter. Considering the average life years of cattle/cow (= 5~6 yrs), the latter is more plausible.\n",
